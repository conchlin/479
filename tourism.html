						<h2>Tourism</h2>

						<p><li>Restaurants: Taniti currently has 10 restaurants: five serve mostly local fish and rice,
							three serve American-style meals, and two serve Pan-Asian cuisine.</li>

							<li>Grocery Stores: Taniti has two supermarkets, two smaller grocery stores, and one convenience
							store that is open 24 hours a day.</li>

							<li>Lodging: Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one
							large, four-star resort. There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of
							bed and breakfasts. All types of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by
							the Tanitian government.</li>

							<li>Entertainment: Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to
							visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history
							museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting
							several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking
							helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a
							nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are
							located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow
							Leaf Bay.</li>

							<li>Sightseeing: Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native
							architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular
							activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to
							Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.</li>

							<li>Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small
							cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a
							small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process
							of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next
							few years.</li>

							<li>Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every
							day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and
							rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are
							available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly
							flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this
							area is easy to explore on foot.</li>
